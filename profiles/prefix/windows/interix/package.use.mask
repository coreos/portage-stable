# mask uuid flag on apr, which would tear in util-linux, which is
# far from building on interix.

# mask git flag from gettext, as gettext's build tries to munge
# some archives with 'root' group, which doesn't exist on interix
# (not even with user/group mapping through suacomp).

# mask optimization flags from eix, as they cause build troubles
# wrt visibility flags - seems gcc 4.2.4 on interix needs another
# patch (it already has one to disable -fvisibility=, but that
# seems to miss -fvisibility-inlines-hidden, etc.)
